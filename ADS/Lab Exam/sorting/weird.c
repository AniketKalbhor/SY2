/*Assume that an array A with n elements was sorted in an ascending order, but two of its elements swapped their positions by a mistake while maintaining the array. 
Write a code to identify the swapped pair of elements and their positions in the asymptotically best possible time. [Assume that all given elements are distinct integers.*/
